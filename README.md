This is a simple command-line implementation of the Tic Tac Toe game in Python. The game allows you to play against a computer opponent.

INSTRUCTIONS
Run the Python script in a Python environment.
The game will prompt you to select a position on the board to place an 'X' (1-9).
The game board will be displayed, showing the current state of the game.
The computer opponent will then make its move and display the updated board.
The game continues until there is a winner or a tie.
After the game ends, you will be asked if you want to play again. Enter 'Y' or 'yes' to play again, or 'N' or 'no' to exit the game.
